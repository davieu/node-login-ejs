A simple login authentication app that uses:
Node, Express, Passport, EJS, Express Sessions, Express-Router, custom Middleware, Flash, Mongoose and MongoDB with Atlas, Encryption

Nothing too snazzy. Wanted to learn about login and authentication

Full login implemented with logout. You can register a new user with email and is saved to a MongoDB. Login with user once registered. Validations implemented for identical emails and password encryption and decryption. Once logged in you are redirected to the dashboard which only shows user name. Flash messages implemented for errors as middleware. Overall a fun project and is something that I have been itching to learn for a bit!!!

todo: deploy to heroku
